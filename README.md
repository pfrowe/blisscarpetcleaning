# Bliss Carpet Cleaning
This is my first complete project as a freelance web developer. It is also my first project using PHP and my first project using
Bootstrap. I'm not new to web development, though; I've been working with ColdFusion for eight years.

Since I'm still learning PHP and Bootstrap, I welcome a review of the code by those more experienced with those technologies. What can I do to make the PHP more readable? What did I reinvent in bcc.base.css that's already a part of Bootstrap?

Technologies utilized:
 * PHP
 * JavaScript
 * MySQL
 * Bootstrap
 * jQuery
