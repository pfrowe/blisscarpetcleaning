# Bliss Carpet Cleaning
This is my first complete project as a freelance web developer. It is also my first project using PHP and my first project using
Bootstrap. I'm not new to web development, though; I've been working with ColdFusion for eight years.

Since I'm new to PHP and Bootstrap, I definitely welcome a review of the code by those with more experience with those technologies. What
can I do to make the PHP more readable? What have I broken in Bootstrap (particularly in css/bcc.core.css) due to an ignorance of some
class or another?

Technologies utilized:
 * PHP
 * JavaScript
 * MySQL
 * Bootstrap
 * jQuery
